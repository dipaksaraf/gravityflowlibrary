Gravity Flow Code Snippet Library
=================================

Gravity Flow is a commercial plugin for WordPress which provides a Workflow platform for forms created in Gravity Forms.

This is a collection of code snippets that help modify the default behavior. Some require customization so please check the code comments.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use. Each file is set up to be a WordPress plugin.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Save the page from your browser to your wp-content/plugins folder and upload to your server. Be sure to save it as a .php file and add it to a folder with the same name as the file (minus the .php). Alternatively you can compress the file as a .zip file and upload as a plugin from within WordPress. 
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.

For files that aren't set up as plugins follow steps 1 and 2 above and then copy and paste the code into your child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, please [get in touch](https://gravityflow.io/contact) and we'll recommend a developer.
